The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements. It just takes all the rows of the 2 tables and displays them as one.
There are, however, a few conditions that the UNION operators require in order to work. They are as follows -
1. Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns.
2. The columns must all have similar data types.
3. The column in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order.


Difference Between Join and Union Operator-

JOIN combines data from many tables based on the condition
It combines data into new columns
The number of columns selected from each table can be different
Datatypes of corresponding columns in different tables can be different

UNION combines the result of two or more SELECT statements
It combines data into new rows 
The number of columns selected from different tables should be the same
Datatypes of corresponding columns in different tables should be the the same

(SELECT * FROM suppliers) UNION (SELECT * FROM company_products);
(SELECT first_name, phone from customers) UNION (SELECT contact_name, phone from suppliers);
(SELECT city, country FROM customers) UNION ALL (SELECT city, country FROM suppliers);
(SELECT city, country FROM customers) INTERSECT (SELECT city, country FROM suppliers);
(SELECT city, country FROM customers WHERE country='USA' OR country='Brazil') UNION (SELECT city, country FROM suppliers WHERE country='USA' OR country='Brazil');
(SELECT customer_id, total_amount FROM company_orders) UNION (SELECT id, 0 from customers);
