Join keyword is usually used to join things.
There are 4 types of join statements -
1. Inner Join - The inner join keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables
2. Full Join - This keyword returns all records that match the records in the left (table1) and right(table2) tables. Full Join and Full outer join both are same
3. Left Join - A Left Join returns all records from the left table (table1) and the matching records from the right table (table2). If there is no match, the right side will show 0 records.
4. Right Join - This keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and all matching records from the left table (table1). If there is no match, 0 records will appear from the left side.
